# AGENTS Instructions

## Coding Guidelines
- Use **TypeScript** and **React** functional components.
- Prefer arrow functions and keep indentation at four spaces.
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling.
- Import modules using the `@/` alias, e.g. `import axios from "@/lib/axios"`.
- Reuse helper components such as `Loader`, `CustomCheckbox`, and `SearchableSelect` where possible.

## Commands
- Install dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` if available).
- Run **lint** checks using `npm run lint` before committing.
- Development server: `npm run dev`.
- Build for production: `npm run build`.

## Commit Messages
- Use short presentâ€‘tense summaries (e.g. `Add patient search component`).
- Include a concise description of what was changed.

## Testing
- Currently the project only provides `npm run lint` for automated checks.
  Ensure this command succeeds before submitting code changes.
